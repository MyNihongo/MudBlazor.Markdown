## With a default delimeter
When  \(a \ne 0\) , there are two solutions to \((ax^2 + bx + c = 0)\) and they are
\(\displaystyle \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\)

## With the dollar sign delimeter
When  $a \ne 0$ , there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ and they are
$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$
